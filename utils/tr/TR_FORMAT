.tr file is used for storing triangles. It is structured to be easily
deserialized and used by C/C++/Objective-C programs. File size is not optimized
to be small.

| number of triangles | sizeof(int)                                 |
| triangles           | number of triangles x 3 x 3 x sizeof(float) |
