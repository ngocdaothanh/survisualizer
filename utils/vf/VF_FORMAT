.vf file is used for storing viewing fields. It is structured to be easily
deserialized by C/C++/Objective-C programs, and the file size is not optimized
to be small.

| segment-per-edge         | sizeof(int)                                        |
| number of viewing fields | sizeof(int)                                        |
| viewing fields           | number of viewing fields x sizeof(a viewing field) |

A viewing field:

| camera position    | 3 x sizeof(float)                                                   |
| heads on camera    | (segment-per-edge + 1) x (segment-per-edge + 1) x 3 x sizeof(float) |
| heads on triangles | (segment-per-edge + 1) x (segment-per-edge + 1) x 3 x sizeof(float) |
