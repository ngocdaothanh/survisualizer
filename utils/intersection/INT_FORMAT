.int file is structured to be easily deserialized by C/C++/Objective-C programs.

number of trianges | sizeof(int)
trianges           | number of trianges x 3 x sizeof(float)
number of cameras  | sizeof(int)
cameras            | number of cameras x sizeof(camera)
                   | camera:
                   | position  | 3 x sizeof(float)
                   | rectangle | 4 x 3 x sizeof(float)
segment-per-edge   | sizeof(int)
intersections      | number of cameras x (segment-per-edge + 1) x (segment-per-edge + 1) x 3 x sizeof(float)
