This research lies in the domain of Outdoor Mixed Reality. It aims to visualize the viewing fields of outdoor surveillance cameras on the screen of mobile devices. In an outdoor environment where cameras on mobile devices can be used, it is required that users can easily understand the visualized viewing fields of surrounding surveillance cameras. Moreover, the visualization system must provide realtime video with no human-sensible delay.

In this research, we study five visualization methods and propose a prototype implementation based on server-side PTAM. The prototype requires no GPS or gyrocompass devices. We have implemented the system and conducted some experiments in our campus.

There are many people and organizations I would like to thank, without my study and this research would not have been possible.

I would like to thank professor Yuichi Ohta, associate professor Yoshinari Kameda, and associate professor Itaru Kitahara of the Computer Vision and Image Media Laboratory for their guidance on the field of computer vision and image processing, their support, comments, and valuable advices in the three years on this research. I would like to thank Shinya Yamazaki, Masayuki Hayashi, and other members of the laboratory for their help and discussion.

I would like to thank the Japanese Ministry of Education which has given me the chance to come to Japan and provided me with Ô¨Ånancial support in the early years. I would like to thank Watanuki International Scholarship Foundation, and Epson International Scholarship Foundation for their generous financial support in the last two years.

I would like to thank my family and friends in Viet Nam and friends in Tokyo, Takamatsu, and Tsukuba for their time, support and encouragement.
