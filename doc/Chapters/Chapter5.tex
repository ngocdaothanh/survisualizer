\lhead{Chapter 5. \emph{Evaluation of Visualization Methods}}

The visualization methods as described in chapter \ref{Chapter3} needs to be evaluated to check for understandability and to see which one is the best one users. In this chapter, we use the reference implementation built in chapter \ref{Chapter4} to setup an experiment in which users are invited to use the system with the five visualization methods. After that, the users are asked to rank the understandability of each method in five levels, from the least to the most understandability.
