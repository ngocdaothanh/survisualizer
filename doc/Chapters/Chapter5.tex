\lhead{Chapter 5. \emph{Evaluation of Visualization Methods}}

In this chapter, we use the prototype implemented in chapter \ref{Chapter4} to conduct an experiment to evaluate the five visualization methods in section \ref{VisualizationMethods}. The purpose of this experiment is to verify the requirements in section \ref{VisualizationRequirements}.

\section{Evaluation Condition}

Ten users are invited to use the system with the five visualization methods. After that, each user are asked to rank each visualization method in the following categories in five levels:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Understandability
	\item Realtimeness
	\item Accuracy
	\item Robustness to the disturbance of passers-by and handshaking movement of the mobile device
\end{itemize}

\section{Result and Discussion}

\subsection{Discussion}

%A good visualization method is the one in which CG objects used to visualize the viewing fields do not occlude the original scene. Moving objects do not occlude the scene over time, thus
