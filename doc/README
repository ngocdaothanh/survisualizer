The width of images should be at most 400px. To convert wider images, "convert"
command line of ImageMagick can be used:
convert -resize 400x input.image output.image

Note for OmiGraffle:
* .graffle can be a file or a directory
* When it is a directory, the Icon file in the directory is named "Icon\r"
by OmniGraffle, thus cannot be committed by Subversion. The file can be safely
renamed to "Icon" to be committed to Subversion repository.
