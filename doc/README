The width of images should be at most 400px. To convert wider images, "convert"
command line of ImageMagick can be used:
convert -resize 400x input.image output.image

Note for OmiGraffle:
* figures.graffle is a directory
* The Icon file in the directory is named "Icon\r" by OmniGraffle, thus cannot
be committed by Subversion. The file can be safely renamed to "Icon" to be
committed.
* Figures are exported to the directory "Figures"
