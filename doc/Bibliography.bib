	Abstract = {The emerging technology of multisensor data fusion has a wide range of applications, both in Department of Defense (DoD) areas and in the civilian arena. The techniques of multisensor data fusion draw from an equally broad range of disciplines, including artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, and statistical estimation. With the rapid evolution of computers and the maturation of data fusion technology, the door to using data fusion in everyday applications is now wide open and presenting great opportunities.The Handbook of Multisensor Data Fusion provides a unique, comprehensive, and up-to-date resource for data fusion systems designers and researchers. Divided into five parts, it:ooffers a thorough introduction to data fusion terminology and modelsodescribes advanced techniques for data association, target tracking, and identificationopresents practical information on system development, including requirements analysis, systems engineering, algorithm selection, database design, human-computer interfaces, and performance assessmentointroduces applications from the DoD, NASA, DARPA, and condition-based monitoring of complex machineryosupplies data fusion resources and Web sitesThe contributing authors are all recognized leaders in data fusion and have collaborated to provide what promises to be the definitive reference for this rapidly developing field. Whether you are a researcher, system designer, implementer, or student, in the Handbook of Multisensor Data Fusion you'll find everything you need, from a basic introduction and survey of data fusion technology to advanced mathematics and theory, including very practical advice on data fusion system development and implementation.},
